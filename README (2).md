# KONNECT
A system to manage the ongoing academic, research and external projects which are done in collaboration with the undergrads of UCSC

### Description
This project was made as the second year academic group project of UCSC. 
Given the number of projects coordinated and carried out within the university, we found thr process through which it was done to be, frankly put, very bothersome and anxiety inducing.
Juggling between waiting for lecturers to reply or whether you're going to risk breaking the rules, is not something you'd want to go though.

Which is why we made __**Konnect**__.

Konnect is made to act as the central application to effectively help students find and collaborate with not just academic staff but external parties as well. Even though at the end of
this project term, it will probably not contain all the requirements this system could potentially be, we hope to build Konnect to make the entire process centralized and more streamlined to eliminate
as much of the existing problems.
